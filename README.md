```bash
# Interactive wizard mode
npm run generate -- interactive --output my-config.json --generate

# Or generate from existing config
node dist/scripts/generate-payer-deployment.js core/examples/medicaid-mco-config.json
```

**What It Generates:**

**Documentation:** [CONFIG-TO-WORKFLOW-GENERATOR.md](./docs/CONFIG-TO-WORKFLOW-GENERATOR.md)

### FHIR R4 Integration (CMS-0057-F Compliant)
Bridge traditional X12 EDI with modern FHIR APIs:

```typescript
import { 
  mapX12270ToFhirEligibility,
  mapX12837ToFhirClaim,
  mapX12278ToFhirServiceRequest,
  mapX12835ToFhirExplanationOfBenefit
} from './src/fhir/fhir-mapper';
import { checkCMSCompliance } from './src/fhir/compliance-checker';

// X12 837 → FHIR Claim
const claim = mapX12837ToFhirClaim(x12_837_data);

// X12 278 → FHIR ServiceRequest (Prior Auth)
const serviceRequest = mapX12278ToFhirServiceRequest(x12_278_data);

// Validate CMS-0057-F compliance
const result = checkCMSCompliance(serviceRequest);
console.log('Compliant:', result.compliant, 'Score:', result.score);
```

**Standards Compliance:**
- CMS-0057-F: Prior Authorization Final Rule ✓
- HIPAA X12: 270/837/278/835 (005010 series) ✓

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests (166+ tests including FHIR)
npm test

# Run FHIR-specific tests
npm run test:fhir

# Generate synthetic test claims
node dist/scripts/utils/generate-837-claims.js 837P 10 ./test-data

# End-to-end health checks
./scripts/test-e2e.ps1 -ResourceGroup my-rg -LogicAppName my-la

# Workflow testing
./test-workflows.ps1 -TestFullWorkflow
```

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance

All logging automatically redacts PHI:

```typescript
import { redactPHI } from './src/security/hipaaLogger';
console.log('Patient:', redactPHI(patient)); // Safe
```

Automated PHI scanning in CI/CD prevents accidental exposure.

### CMS-0057-F Interoperability & Patient Access

Cloud Health Office is designed to support **CMS-0057-F** (CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule) compliance:

**Regulatory Mandate:**
- **Patient Access API:** FHIR R4 API enabling patients to access their health information
- **Provider Access API:** FHIR R4 API for providers to access patient data with consent
- **Payer-to-Payer API:** Data exchange during member transitions between payers
- **Prior Authorization API:** FHIR-based prior authorization workflow automation

**Development Best Practices:**

✅ **Code Generation (80% automated):** Handlebars templates and AI-assisted prompts generate API scaffolding, resource mappers, and test suites to accelerate development while ensuring consistency.

✅ **Security Review:** All PRs require security validation:
- No hard-coded secrets (Azure Key Vault/environment variables only)
- Mandatory PHI/PII redaction in logs (`redactPHI()` function)
- Comprehensive audit logging for all data access operations
- CodeQL security scans with zero critical/high findings

✅ **Automated Testing/CI:** Full test coverage enforced:
- **Jest Test Suite:** Unit, integration, and compliance tests (90%+ coverage)
- **API Coverage:** Patient, Coverage, ExplanationOfBenefit, Encounter, Procedure, Observation
- **OAuth 2.0 Validation:** Token validation and scope enforcement tests
- **Performance SLA:** Response time <1s (95th percentile), bulk export within 5s
- **CI/CD Integration:** All tests run on every PR with mandatory pass requirement

✅ **Prioritized Roadmap:**
- **2026 Q2:** Patient Access API (Priority 1 - foundational compliance)
- **2027 Q2:** Provider Access API (Priority 2 - care coordination)
- **2027 Q4:** Payer-to-Payer API (Priority 3 - member transitions)
- **2028 Q2:** Prior Authorization API (Priority 4 - workflow automation)

✅ **Sandbox Testing:** Dedicated Azure sandbox environment with synthetic test data, validated against CMS Blue Button 2.0, Da Vinci PDex, and CARIN BB reference implementations.

✅ **Compliance Reporting:** Detailed documentation of API coverage, US Core/CARIN BB/Da Vinci IG conformance, timelines, and configuration checklists for auditors and certification bodies.

**Implementation Guides Supported:**
- **US Core v3.1.1** - Patient, Coverage, ExplanationOfBenefit (60% complete)
- **CARIN BB v1.0.0** - Consumer Directed Payer Data Exchange (60% complete)
- **Da Vinci PDex v1.0.0** - Payer Data Exchange (planned 2027)
- **Da Vinci PAS v1.1.0** - Prior Authorization Support (planned 2028)
